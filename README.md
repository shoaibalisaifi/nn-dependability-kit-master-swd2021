ABSTRACT:
Can the neural networks be tested and checked in the similar fashion in which we 
test software and various applications. In this project we have presented and 
demonstrated a neural network dependability kit which is a toolbox to check 
whether the neural network used for autonomous driving system is safe or not. 
We have followed the step by step approach in order to judge the reliability of 
neural networks, the toolkit covers these scientific approaches namely a) 
dependability metrics to check the uncertainties in the project b) checking any 
undesired behavior and c) runtime monitoring to check if decision made by a 
neural network is corresponding to the trained data.
